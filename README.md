# Buzz Me In

I can buzz people into my building with a callbox, but I'd like to be able to let myself in with a secret code.  I wrote this (tiny) app to act as a phone number for my callbox and give me a few seconds to enter a secret code before dialing my cell phone number to let me buzz people in as usual.

## Setup

Use the URL for `callbox.xml` as your "Voice Request URL" on Twilio.

Set a PIN in `pin.php` and your real phone number in `callbox.xml`.  That's it.
